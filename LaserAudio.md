# Introduction #

With further advancements in wireless technology, companies had unfortunately distanced themselves from extremely affordable wireless sound systems. I have decided to allocate current materials at budget costs and fabricate our own wireless speaker system.

Sound travels at a completely different speed than light. This has been billed at approximately 300 million meters per second. However, the speed of sound is far less, at about 343 meters per second. I reasoned that in order to transfer sound through wireless or through a light signal, I will have to lower the speed at which the light travels, or much more easily, heavily resist the transmitted light before being emitted as sound.

I have a profound interest in lasers and take initiative to use them in some of our projects. Amusingly, lasers can actually transfer sound by altering the intensity of light proportional to the pitch at which it is emitted. Therefore, a low pitched sound will emit a barely visible beam. We looked at the various parts and components which can be used in this circuit, and came to the following:
  * Transformer: modulates the power reaching the laser in the circuit. It will increase or decrease the light intensity directly proportional to the volume or pitch of the sound
  * Solar cell or Photo-transistor: This component receives the modulated light beam and transfers it to the audio-output jack

# Progress #

_We completed this project in September 2009, it can be built using the procedure and materials below:_
### Materials List ###
We will use the following materials in building our sound system:
  * 5pin Audio Transformer
  * Cadmium-Sulphide Photocell
  * 2 Audio Jacks
  * Some wire – ONLY to connect the components!
  * Laser – 630 to 650 mm wavelength powered by 4.5 volts
  * Batteries
  * Breadboard
### The Procedure/Construction ###
  1. Transmitter
    * Remove the button-cell batteries from the laser. Solder the negative lead to the spring in the laser.
    * Our Audio transformer has 5 pins, 3 on the front and 2 at the back. Connect the positive lead to any of the outermost pins on the front of the transformer. Then connect a lead from the other outermost pin on the front to the case of the laser.
    * On the back of the transformer connect the leads from the audio jack.
  1. Receiver
    * Simply connect the photocell to a battery and wire it system to the audio-out jack
