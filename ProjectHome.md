**This technology will be integrated into [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/) as an app. Waiting for the Tango Development Kit to attempt to implement something similar with [Project Tango](https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/#project).**

Utilizing colour tracking and 3D graph calculations to plot tracked points and interact with holographs. The final product will be inexpensive and portable.

Imagine a device that finally lets you bring a real object into the virtual world. Control games and applications with simple objects like a soda can. Take photos just by holding up a frame to a camera, and move content from one place (computer) to another with drag and drop.

This project will utilize the TUIO protocol to report coordinates of our detected colour markers and publish this with the help of OpenCV (computer vision framework). This should all fit onto a wearable device.
